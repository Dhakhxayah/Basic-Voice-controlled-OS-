# Basic-Voice-controlled-OS-
This project focuses on the development of an interactive, voice-controlled virtual assistant
system designed to simplify daily tasks and enhance user productivity through seamless human-
computer interaction. The assistant utilizes speech recognition powered by the Vosk library to
process real-time audio input and execute user commands. It incorporates text-to-speech (TTS)
capabilities using pyttsx3, providing dynamic and audible responses for improved user
engagement.
The system leverages multiple libraries and APIs to perform diverse operations, including but
not limited to:
 Managing system-level tasks, such as launching applications, retrieving battery status, or
initiating system shutdown/restart.
 Accessing and automating web services through Google searches, WhatsApp messaging,
and real-time weather updates.
 Handling file management by creating notes and facilitating automated typing.
 Delivering creative entertainment through joke generation and music playback.
Additional functionalities, such as real-time clock and date retrieval, ensure practical relevance,
while weather integration highlights its ability to leverage HTTP requests for external API
interactions. This project showcases the effective use of operating system-level commands,
networking, and automation tools to create a comprehensive assistant. With its efficient
multitasking capabilities and a user-friendly interface, the system represents a robust solution to
modern-day productivity needs.
